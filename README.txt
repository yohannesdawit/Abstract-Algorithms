Quickhull.py
Input should be a list of ordered pairs representing the points. The output should be a list of segments
(pairs of points), that describe the convex hull polygon (connecting the segments in order gives the hull polygon).
includes a driver program (Zelle Graphics) that demonstrates the algorithm by generating a random set of n points 
and then computing the convex hull and showing the results graphically by plotting the points and the convex hull polygon


Knapsack.py
The knapsack.py file contains the Knapsack class which uses the concept of Dynamic Programming
by storing the previously calculated values by the algorithm using the memoization technique 
provided by Python. It calculates the best valued subset of items from the ones provided by the user
that can fit in the knapsack of specified capacity.


Tree23.py
he tree23.py includes the classes Node and Tree23 that help in making balanced trees that can store 2 
or 3 values in their nodes.

PriorityQueue
contains build_heap(lst, lst_size) which converts a list into a heap (starting at index 0) and uses 
heapsort(lst, index, lst_size) as a helping function to achieve this. The last fnction is heap_sort(lst) 
which utilizes build_heap to first make a heap out of the provided list and then sort the list from there.
while using bubble_up and down to sort through the list
